# simple-cms
A simple CMS where the admin can edit, delete, and create articles.
To gain access to the admin's panel, just add /admin/ to the url. The admin's panel is protected by basic auth.
The username is "harry" and password is "password".

Make sure to configue the SMTP server, I've entered some basic text to fill in the spaces.
